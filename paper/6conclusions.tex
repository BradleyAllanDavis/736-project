\section{Conclusions}
Our paper provides analysis of btrees running on HDD and different SSDs. Through the experiments, we present the configuration of btree on SSD is different from HDD, at the same time: it's a complicated work to configure a btree with different SSDs.
Furthermore, we propose an optimization to the btree to better utilize the internal parallelism of SSD.
