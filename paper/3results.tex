\section{Results}

\subsection{Experiment: Search Static B-Tree}
Here, we present the experiments we design to answer the first question: how performance of btree differs on SSDs and HDDs. First, 

\subsubsection{NVMe}

\subsubsection{SATA SSD}

\subsubsection{HDD}

\subsection{TakeAway 1: how to configure btree to obtain optimal performance on SSd or HDD}



\subsection{Experiment: influence of SSD internal parallelism to Read/Write performance}
