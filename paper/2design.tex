\subsection{Experimental Setup and Methodology}

\subsubsection{B-Tree Implementation}
We were able to find a B-Tree implementation \cite{externalbtree} that utilizes external memory (disks) for storing the data structure. This implementation is written in C, single-threaded, and does not make use of a buffer (cache) layer. This implementation lacked \texttt{update(key, value)} or \texttt{delete(key)} functionality, however, we felt that \texttt{insert(key, value)} and \texttt{search(key)} provided a sufficient level of operation to explore our metrics of interest.\\

We modified the B-Tree implementation to measure and output SSD/storage pertinent metrics:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item Transactions per second
    \item Total completion time
    \item IO time
    \item Number of nodes read
    \item Height of tree
    \item Total IO size
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Cloublab Experimental Platform}
For our experiments we used Cloublab \cite{cloublab}
